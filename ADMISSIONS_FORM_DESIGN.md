# PEP Admissions Form - Design Document

## Design Principles

1. **Avoid leading questions** - Don't ask "Do you believe children learn naturally?" (everyone will say yes)
2. **Use scenarios and trade-offs** - Force choices that reveal true priorities
3. **Ask for specifics** - Vague beliefs are easy to fake; concrete examples aren't
4. **Open-ended responses** - How they write reveals how they think
5. **Non-gameable** - Impossible to guess the "right" answer

## Section 1: About Your Child

- Child's name, age, current school (if any)

- **"Describe a recent moment when your child was completely absorbed in something. What were they doing?"**
  *(Reveals if parent notices/values intrinsic engagement)*

- **"What does your child resist or avoid? How do you typically handle it?"**
  *(Reveals parenting style - coercion vs. curiosity)*

---

## Section 2: Scenario Questions (Open-Ended)

*Present each scenario and ask parents to respond in 1-2 sentences.*

### Learning & Progress

1. **"Your child is 6 years old and still not reading, while their cousin of the same age reads fluently. A relative points this out at a family gathering. How do you respond to them, and how do you feel internally?"**

2. **"Your child has spent three weeks deeply obsessed with insects - watching them, drawing them, talking about them constantly - but hasn't touched math in that time. What's your reaction?"**

3. **"The school tells you your child is 'behind grade level' in writing but shows exceptional thinking and verbal ability. What questions do you ask, and what would reassure you?"**

4. **"Your child says: 'I hate math. I never want to do it.' How would you want the school to handle this?"**

### Competition & Achievement

5. **"Your child comes home and says their friend won a medal at another school's competition. They ask why PEP doesn't have competitions or medals. What do you tell them?"**

6. **"Your child has no grades, no ranks, no report card with percentages. When your parents or in-laws ask 'how is she doing in school?', what do you tell them?"**

7. **"An old friend says: 'All this alternative education is fine, but eventually they have to face the real world with competition and pressure. Aren't you sheltering them?' How do you respond?"**

### Discipline & Structure

8. **"Your child refuses to participate in an activity that the school offers. They just don't want to. What do you expect the school to do?"**

9. **"There's no homework. Your child comes home and plays all evening. Your spouse/parent says 'Shouldn't they be doing something educational?' What do you say?"**

10. **"Your child is struggling with something difficult and wants to give up. What do you believe is the right balance between letting them quit and pushing them to persist?"**

### The Future

11. **"It's board exam year. Your child is at PEP while friends' children are in intensive coaching with 6 hours of daily study. How do you feel? What do you do?"**

12. **"Your child decides they want to pursue something unconventional - art, music, wildlife photography - rather than engineering or medicine. What's your honest reaction?"**

13. **"Ten years from now, what would make you feel that choosing PEP was the right decision? What would make you regret it?"**

### Your Own Beliefs

14. **"What do you believe children need that traditional schools fail to provide?"**

15. **"What's one thing you wish had been different about your own schooling?"**

---

## Section 3: Your Story

- **"Why are you considering PEP *now*? What changed or happened?"**
  *(Looking for: genuine search for alternatives vs. running away from a problem)*

- **"What concerns, if any, do you have about this approach?"**
  *(Honest admission of doubts = good. "No concerns at all" = either naive or lying)*

- **"What would make you pull your child out of PEP?"**
  *(Reveals true priorities. Red flag: "If they fall behind grade level." Green flag: "If they stopped being happy/curious.")*

---

## Section 4: Practical Commitment

- **"PEP runs until Grade 10. How long do you envision your child here?"**
  *(One year = red flag)*

- **"Will both parents/guardians be aligned on this decision? Briefly describe any differences in perspective."**
  *(Honest acknowledgment of spouse disagreement = manageable. Hidden disagreement = time bomb)*

## Internal Scoring Guide

### Classification Framework

| Category | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Green** | Genuinely aligned, ready to enroll | Admit readily |
| **Yellow** | Intellectually agrees but anxious, not fully converted | Conversion pathway (workshops, observations, follow-up) |
| **Red** | Fundamentally misaligned, looking for conventional outcomes | Decline gracefully |

### Green Flag Language
- "I trust...", "I believe they'll...", "I'm okay with..."
- Specific examples about their own child
- Acknowledges their own anxiety but doesn't let it drive decisions
- Focuses on who the child IS, not what they should BECOME
- Sees childhood as valuable in itself, not just preparation

### Yellow Flag Language
- "I understand, but...", "I agree in principle, however..."
- Keeps returning to benchmarks, comparisons, timelines
- Intellectually agrees but language reveals underlying anxiety
- Focused on reassurance-seeking
- Genuine curiosity mixed with conventional worry

### Red Flag Language
- "How will you ensure...", "How will you make sure..."
- "At par with," "grade level," "catch up," "keep up"
- Comparisons to other children as the standard
- Views childhood primarily as preparation for adulthood
- "Real world," "eventually," "but later..."
- Wants PEP to deliver conventional outcomes through unconventional methods
- Talks about "fixing" their child or making them "normal"
- "No concerns at all" (not self-aware or performative)

## Common Parent Questions (Context)

These questions aren't necessarily red flags on their own - it's HOW parents ask and HOW they respond to answers that matters:

- When will my child learn to write?
- How will you ensure my child is at par with grade level?
- How will you prep them for conventional academic schooling?
- How will you ensure they're ready for board exams?
- If children have choice and don't choose math/language, how will you ensure they do it?
- How will children meet the reality of the world if they're always doing what they want?
- Children in conventional schools do so much math and homework - how will mine keep up?
- How will they deal with no competition, scores, marks, or ranks?

**Green:** Parent asks, listens to answer, shows genuine openness. "That makes sense, I hadn't thought of it that way."

**Yellow:** Parent keeps circling back despite good answers. Intellectually accepts but can't let go of anxiety.

**Red:** Parent asks in a way that reveals they've already decided. "But surely they NEED homework to learn discipline?" The question is a statement of belief.

## Yellow Flag Conversion Pathway

For families showing genuine interest but not fully aligned:

1. **Do not admit immediately**
2. Require attendance at parent workshops
3. Assign specific reading materials
4. Invite them to observe classrooms (multiple visits)
5. Schedule follow-up conversation after 2-4 weeks
6. Look for demonstrable shift in mindset
7. Only admit after genuine conversion OR let them self-select out

## Notes

- ~30% of current student base estimated to be "yellow flag"
- Yellow-flag families create disproportionate friction for teachers
- They often exit around Grade 3-4 anyway when pressure mounts
- Tightening admissions short-term builds stronger community long-term
- Some of the best advocates started anxious but truly converted
